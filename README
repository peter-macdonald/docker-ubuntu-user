A docker container to run Ubuntu as a user.

I built this to aid in testing things on clean ubuntu installs without having to fire up a new VM,
but the use cases are up to you!

To invoke from dockerhub:
    docker run -it petermacdonald/ubuntu-user

To build yourself and run:
    docker build -t ubuntu-user .
    docker run -it ubuntu-user
